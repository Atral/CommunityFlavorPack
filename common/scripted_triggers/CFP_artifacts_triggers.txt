# You can catch those triggers in your own mod. E.g. to create artifacts, bind them to event, etc.
# Just overwrite bellow triggers with your own conditions in your mod files (file name does not have to match, just trigger name).
#
# Be aware that:
# -----------
# 1: triggers must always be set, I could not leave them empty.
# 2: it means your mod should be loaded after CFP so your own definition of the trigger is the one running.
# 3: if trigger = true then item will 100% show-up. 
#
# Formatting
# -----------
# cfp_force_XXX_trigger
